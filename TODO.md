# Roadmap to Hyperrealistic Civilization Simulator

The current project provides a procedural world, basic entities and buildings, and a minimal UI. The following steps outline how to evolve it into a detailed civilization simulator. Each section builds on the previous ones and can be implemented incrementally.

## 1. Core Engine Expansion
- Modular simulation loop supporting very large maps and thousands of entities
- Chunked world streaming and persistence with save/load functionality
- Time system with day/night cycles, seasons and calendar years

## 2. Environment and World Simulation
- Generate elevation, rivers and coastlines using erosion algorithms
- Simulate climate zones, weather patterns and seasonal resource variation
- Model soil fertility, vegetation growth and wildlife populations
- Implement water flow and groundwater to support agriculture

## 3. Entities and Artificial Intelligence
- Add genetics, detailed physiology and psychological states
- Replace simple actions with behaviour trees or GOAP planning
- Introduce professions and skill progression through learning
- Handle aging, illness, injuries and recovery processes

## 4. Societies and Culture
- Support social groups from families to tribes and nations
- Track cultural traits, languages and shared knowledge
- Implement religion, traditions and social norms affecting behaviour
- Allow settlements to grow into towns and cities

## 5. Economy and Production
- Expand inventory into item stacks, tools and quality levels
- Create production chains for farming, hunting, crafting and mining
- Add markets, trade routes and dynamic pricing of goods
- Track ownership, storage and transportation of resources

## 6. Buildings and Infrastructure
- Introduce varied building types: homes, workshops, farms, roads and forts
- Allow building upgrades, deterioration and maintenance costs
- Improve pathfinding to account for roads and terrain improvements
- Provide settlement planning with zoning and density management

## 7. Politics and Governance
- Model forms of government, laws and taxation
- Implement diplomacy, alliances and conflict between groups
- Track leadership succession and political factions

## 8. Technology and Progression
- Develop a research tree unlocking new tools and buildings
- Enable cultural and technological diffusion between societies
- Simulate historical eras with corresponding advancements

## 9. Conflict and Warfare
- Add combat units with morale, logistics and battlefield AI
- Implement territory control, sieges and peace negotiations

## 10. Events and Simulation Depth
- Incorporate random events such as disasters, plagues and migrations
- Simulate long term climate change and its effects
- Provide analytics for population, economy and historical timelines

## 11. Visualization and Tools
- Upgrade graphics to rich 2D or 3D rendering with zooming
- Offer dashboards for demographics, economy and politics
- Expose modding hooks and scripting for custom behaviour

## 12. Scalability and Optimization
- Profile performance and use concurrency where helpful
- Employ spatial data structures for efficient queries
- Support headless simulation for long running worlds
